# Flask for managing Dash dashboards

# `flaskboard`

Embed Dash apps in Flask apps while maximizing the power of both:

* Integration using standard tools (Dash's server parameter)
* Register all your Dash apps as blueprints in one main Flask app
* No hacky iframes
* Dash apps are integrated simply like embedding images (did you know the `Dash.index()` method?), or just a div somewhere (wherever you want)
* Manage a an app utilizing the full power of Flask
* No SEO compromises
